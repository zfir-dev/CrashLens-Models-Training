# CrashLens-Models-Training

NOTE: These training files in this repository was used to train the AI model for the CrashLens API and CrashLens Mobile Application

## Description

The CrashLens API and CrashLens Mobile Application is a university project that can help car insurers or even car owners to identify damages on vehicles. The API is an automated system that will take input of car images and process the image in a Machine Learning algorithm to identify the type of the damages on a car. The CrashLens applications is being developed and maintained by a group of participants at the University of Mauritius. Any bugs/defects that is found on the system can be reported on the contacts below.
